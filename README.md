# Interpreting Nonlinear Survey Data Models through Interactive Visualization with Application to the Survey of Business Owners

## Summary

This repository hosts the code for  "Interpreting Nonlinear Survey Data Models through Interactive Visualization with Application to the Survey of Business Owners" by P.A. Parker and D. Vedensky.

We fit a Bayesian pseudo-likelihood extreme learning machine model to complex survey data in order to predict the probability that a small business is a primary source of income for its owner. 
These model predictions are displayed in a Shiny app hosted [here](https://paparker.shinyapps.io/ices_vi_student_comp/).
