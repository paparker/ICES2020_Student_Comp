# Interpreting Nonlinear Survey Data Models through Interactive Visualization with Application to the Survey of Business Owners

## Summary

This repository hosts the code for our submission to the Sixth International Conference on Establishment Statistics (ICES VI) student contest. 
We fit a Bayesian neural network model to complex survey data in order to predict the probability that a small business is a primary source of income for its owner. 
These model predictions are displayed in a Shiny app hosted [here](https://paparker.shinyapps.io/ices_vi_student_comp/). 
Further details about the contest, including the data set, can be found on [the contest webpage](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/ices/2021/studentcontest.cfm).
